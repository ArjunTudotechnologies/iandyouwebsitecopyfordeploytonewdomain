              importantly Girl children dwelling in slums and from poverty
              stricken backgrounds, approximately 8 to 10 million girls in India
              aged between 6 and 17 do not go to school mainly because of gender
              bias, culturally imbibed malpractices, human trafficking, child
              marriage, poor health and sanitation are some of the problems
              which continue to plague them and the biggest of them all is the
              lack of education always ignored due to flawed perceptions of
              family members about girls are just as dangerous.
            </p>
            <p>
              I and You -Vidhya aims at providing education which results in
              increased retention and learning outcomes that helps focus on
              planning and guiding themselves as well as their family members. I
              and You -Vidhya aims not only to empower the girl child for the
              benefit of her family but, to make her a strong individual who
              will grow up to take decisions personally and professionally and
              also make it a necessity to educate her own children who will be
              the future of the Nation.

              backgrounds, by educating their parents and guardians about the
              opportunities that surround their children, especially the girl
              children who can rise to an extent where they can shape their
              future in the best possible ways which was just a dream in the
              past and to uplift the livelihood as well as to bring the best out
              of themselves, to achieve this we seek support from our trained
              volunteers who dedicate their quality time during their weekly
              holidays to go to slums, identify children between ages 6
