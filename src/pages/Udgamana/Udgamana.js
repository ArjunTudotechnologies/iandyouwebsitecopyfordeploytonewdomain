          <div className="text-justify">
            <p>
              what is difference between you and others or me and you ? that is
              the level of awareness , some have less , some have moderate and
              some have more , the one possessing more, for such person the
              possibility of success is more , he can taste the success not only
              in one field but, in any field.
            </p>
            <p>
              Awareness is life , How do we know that we exist ? how do we know
              that other person and the world exists ? because we are aware of
              the fact that ourselves, others and the world exists , all these
              facts of existence are the contents of our awareness ,the contents
              which we experience through our perceptions, awareness is the fact
              of existence through which one can perceive the experiences of
              sensations , thoughts , emotions and feelings of self and others ,
              <b>the contents of awareness has been raised in our awareness,</b>
              the contents of our awareness can be perceived through feelings,
              emotions , thoughts and sensations .
            </p>
            <p>
              when one raises his/her awareness from the ground level to a
              higher level on objective and subjective experiences, it will
              unfold the universal awareness , through which one can be aware
              that all the existence around us the objective and subjective
              experience , just rises and subsides in the universal awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Udgamana</b> means - Rise or Blossom - in what ? in your
              awareness, the awareness word itself is tricky, if you see oxford
              dictionary it says - having knowledge or realization. Even this
              meaning is difficult for an ordinary man to understand, We know
              the meaning of knowledge; but the other word, 'realization' ?
              Again, the dictionary says. -To be fully aware of, to accept as a
              fact, to convert a hope or plan into a fact. Here also, the
              meaning is so complicated that it is difficult to get a total
              grasp of its depth.
            </p>
            <p>
              so what is the awareness ? and the ways to rise - Self awareness
              and the Universal awareness
            </p>
            <p>
              so.. in the teachings of shaktha process, srividhya speaks on
              <b>7- Seven</b> levels of our awareness [the Seven States of the
              Seven Perceivers <b>-pramatris</b> and their respective energies
              <b>-pramatri saktis</b>] which are very essential in spiritual
              process and even in normal way to lead a life , why it is
              essential to raise is because, Awareness is a fundamental basis or
              a ground for our being or consciousness , through which one can
              have clear perception of our self , society , situations and the
              people around us.
            </p>
            <p>
              What we experience in our life is a content of our awareness, one
              can perceive through his/her feelings, emotions , thoughts and
              sensations as said earlier. by rising ones awareness one can
              change his/her perceptions towards the self , family, situations
              of society and the world.
            </p>

          <p>
            There is something awaiting you; the cosmos , the divine mother ,
            the guru and the life is waiting for you to awake ! the awaken
            sadhak only can celebrate his/her life of higher potential.
          </p>
          <p>
            No matter how much of bank balance, fancy cars, big plot, status in
            society, name, fame and professional success you may have only a
            very few will experience the real success and wealth in their life,
            that is freedom, freedom from mind's bothering’s, freedom from
            emotional disturbances and freedom from false prestige. Let all of
            it be for sometime but that small amount of freedom will make you to
            realize your true self and bring you the holistic life.
          </p>
          <p>
            The motive of Udgamana sadhana is to make one feel his freedom and
            make one to celebrate life with all its higher potential, it is
            possible when one comes to know how well one can deal with life's
            challenges, situations and circumstances as they come.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through those challenges, anyone can stay calm, happy, peaceful etc,
            when things are going well and everything is going their way but
            when life goes on in its own way, it seems to be like it is going
            against to your will and wish or plans, the best indicator of your
            level of consciousness is how you deal with life's challenges when
            they come.
          </p>
          <p>
            The people who you spend time with, affects the way you think, feel,
            speak, and act. Your environment is everything.
            <b>It affects the way you think, feel, speak, and act,</b> and it
            shapes your beliefs, desires, and values, it’s hard to focus on
            awakening and enlightenment if you’re constantly surrounded by
            noise, crime, and violence, and you are always fearing for your
            safety.
          </p>
          <p>
