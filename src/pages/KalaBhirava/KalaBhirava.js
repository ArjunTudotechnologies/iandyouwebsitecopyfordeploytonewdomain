              In srividhya traditions Bhirava means Guru , Guru for knowledge,
              awareness, principle and the path , being a Srividhya sadhak the
              role of the guru is immeasurable, to tread in the path of
              spirituality without the grace and blessings of the guru is
              impossible to attain the absolute truth , the Astami dhyana the
              lord of time and death and his grace and blessings will make the
              sadhak to transcend the time and mortality. Kalabhirava Astami
              Dhyana which falls on the eighth day after the full moon day in
              every month is referred as Kalabhirava ashtami As per the lunar
              calendar.

          <h2 className="title-small mt-5 mb-4">According to Puranas</h2>
          <p>
            Kala Bhairava is delineated as “Lord of Time”. He is well-known as-
            Kshetrapalaka, the protector of the Universe. Kala Bhairava is one
            of the vehement Manifestations of Lord Shiva. He portrays as a
            vicious deity humping a Head in one of his hands. the head which God
            carries was the 5th head of Lord Brahma, chopped off by 
            <b>Lord Shiva</b> to cut his ego. Black Dog is the Vehicle (Vahan)
            on which he sits.
          </p>

          <h2 className="title-small mt-5 mb-4">THE TANTRA POINT OF VIEW</h2>
          <p>
            Bhairava encompasses the entire universe within himself; all the
            Shaktis seamlessly merging into him; becoming one with him. In
            Tantra, Bhairava is both an aspect of Shiva and a supremely divine
            mantra, capable of transporting the seeker into the highest realms
            of consciousness.
          </p>

          <p>
            When Shiva completely withdraws into himself and immerses himself in
            his own consciousness, he rises in the awareness of being one with
            Kali. Thus emerges the form of Bhairava, the masculine aspect of
            Kali herself, who manifests as Bhairavi. This union of the potent
            male and female energies in the universe lacks any intrinsic
            qualities - it is pure, effulgent light. The thing to note here is
            that the dark, evil-looking intensity depicted in the forms of
            Bhairava and Bhairavi do not actually imply evil intent.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            The very nature of Bhairava is to look inward and not outward the
            inward journey; eventually experiencing his existence within the
            womb of Kali, who manifests as Bhairavi. From this dark abyss arises
            the terrible form of Bhairava. Similarly, the Bhairava-Bhairavi
            union aims to educate the seeker to defy the dark forces of evil,
            ignorance and violence; journey into himself; understand that he
            comes from within the womb of the Universal Mother, Kali; then
            finally transform himself to emerge as powerful pure energy, which
            can help serve humanity in ways he could otherwise not even imagine
            possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            Seen from this perspective, Bhairava or Mahakala is a tantric deity,
            which symbolizes an internalizing, holistic, healing force, which
            helps a sadhak towards self-fulfillment and actualization of
            desires. The energy of Bhairava emerges as a driving force, which
            overcomes every obstacle to achieve all that it seeks. It is
            therefore seen as "destructive" - that which destroys everything
            which comes in the way of its own fulfillment

            THE SPIRITUAL SYMBOLISM BEHIND KALABHAIRAVA-
          </h2>
          <p>
            The Kala means time and Bhirava means beyond time , the kalabhirava
            means the time and beyond which has neither past nor future but
            which is verily available , verily available in present , in the
            present moment that means now , now this moment , The vehicle of
            Kalabhairava is shwaana (a dog). It is the most fearsome depiction
            of Lord Shiva or Lord Para Bhirava.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Kalabhairava is the lord of death and the lord of time. In
            spirituality, the words death and time are symbolic.{" "}
          </p>
          <p>
            Shwaana is formed of two words shwa and na. In Vedic literature, the
            meaning of shwa is tomorrow and yesterday, and the meaning of na is
            not, So shwaana means something which is neither yesterday nor
            tomorrow, something which is only in the now, the present moment.
            So, Kalabhairava is someone who is neither yesterday nor tomorrow.
            He is ever-present in the now. Also, Lord Kalabhairava is the lord
            of the city of Kashi. This also has a symbolic meaning. In tantra,
            Kashi is recognized as Agya Chakra, which is located in between the
            eyebrows (Bhru - madhye)
          </p>
          <p>
            when the sadhak is capable to still his mind between the eyebrows
            one can experience his presence in the present moment , Kala the
            time which dissolves everything It signifies that time eats away
            everything, Anything that is present in this world, it will dissolve
            and perish with time, even the past and the future but in reality
            there is no such past or future here only present is available but
            our own mind is not allowing us to experience that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kalabhirava dhyana is such a process which brings his grace and
            blessings which makes the sadhaks to experience his presence, means
            the state of such awareness which is beyond time. where is the time?
            It is not in the past or the future, the past which your mind is
            perceiving that perception which is now , it is now in the present
            moment in the mean time the future which your mind is planning, even
            that is also happening now , now in the present moment, It is now.
            And when this realization of time and present moment strikes upon
            us, our Agya Chakra gets heightened, signifying the presence of Lord
            Kalabhairava in us. This leads us to the deepest state of samadhi
            which is also called a state of Bhairava.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the Kalabhairava Ashtami, as praised by Adi Shankaracharya in his
            Ashtakam as the Lord of Kashi, he actually means the Agya Chakra –
            signifying total awareness of the present moment.
