              Målā means the impurities or negative energy or Black energy ,
              this Målā is neither formless nor has form , there are three types
              , Physical , Mental and Emotional, there are many reasons that
              form or accumulate impurities some have been mentioned below ,
              scientifically it is an exchange of energy the compatible energy
              is considered as positive energy and incompatible is negative
              energy but in reality there is no such positive or negative,
              energy it is just energy

              Nirmalikarana kriya means cleansing the three layers of our
              existence with Five elements and with the blessings of cosmic
              universal mother energy . Black magic Evil eye and Spell Negative
              thoughts and emotions like envy , Jealous and hatred Interaction
              with incompatible energy etc... Black magic has traditionally been
              referred to the use of supernatural powers for evil and selfish
              purposes with respect to the left-hand path and right-hand path
              dichotomy Black magic is the malicious, left-hand counterpart of
              the benevolent white magic.

            <p>
              In modern times some find that the definition of "black magic" has
              been convoluted by people who define ritualistic practices that
              they disapprove of as "black magic". The evil eye is one of the
              strongest and most prominent symbols in the world, so chances are
              you've seen it or heard of it at one time or another in your life

              eye's meaning stems from the concept that People who do well and
              Achieve great success are affected by it. The look or glare which
              carries emotions are manifested into a curse that brings
              misfortune to the receiver who is usually unaware of the malicious
              gaze upon them most cultures believe that jealousy is the main
              source of the evil eye.

                Here is the solution to identifying and treating yourself and
                your beloved one's under such influence, before that let's see
                the above mentioned in the scientific dimension.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Here as per modern science everything is energy and vibration
              (Chithanya & Spanda ) from which the whole existence has come to
              exist from one energy and people as well as living and nonliving
              are all connected to each other, when we touch , when we speak,
              when we think and feel we share our energies through touch, Sex ,
              words, thoughts, and feelings. The energy gets exchanged with each
              other, it can also happen at our working place , while travelling,
              in mass gatherings like functions, meetings etc ..{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              One of the greatest secret of the energy is that, no matter what
              your age , gender or health condition, the positive or negative
              energy will get exchanged. Energy exists all around us in both
              positive and negative forms and hence we share it with each other
              in both forms, the energy that surrounds us is constantly moving
              and changing, transforming and redefining us and everything around
              us. The energy that is good and positive (created through love and
              happiness) have the higher vibrations and hence it is light and
              remains at the height while the energy that is bad and negative
              (created through our judgment, envy and negative thoughts ) have
              low vibrations and are hence heavy and remains at the lower side.
              So it is us who decides the kind of energy that can connect to us
              and can vibrate inside us. The energy which we absorb helps us to
              redefine our spiritual life and growth, it is said that energy
              exchange is a vital process which enhances our spiritual growth
              and allows us to accumulate high levels of energy in our body. We
              all are made of energy and perform our daily activities because of
              the energy present in our body, we feel weak and tired if there is
              a lack of energy in our system.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Generally we acquire our energy to carry out our daily activities
              through the intake of food, water and sleep but we can also get
              the energy through the energy exchange method. In this process we
              exchange the energy with the other individual with high vibrations
              and transfer it in our system, this can also be done with the
              universal energy(Vishwa Chaithanya) present around us. This way
              our aura, body, mind and emotions will receive energy or charge
              through our energy centers ( shakthi chakra )which is full of
              positive energy and when the alignment is good it creates good
              protection and shield to our body to dissolve the unwanted
              negative energies.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are three ways of energy exchange that is through mind,
              through body and through our spiritual centers which is defined
              through our chakras and aura. When we speak with people we use all
              these three ways to exchange the energy with each other and hence
              we need to be careful when the energy is transferred because we
              might pollute our mind, our body and our chakra if the connection
              drops down to the lower side. We have been always taught that we
              need to think good,speak good and do good deeds when we connect to
              people more often it helps us absorb better vibrations and hence
              we need to choose our friends and our companion carefully so that
              they can help us. We grow and multiply energy from the power
              within us not that they drain us, if the energy is not good for
              our inner being then it might drain us and make us feel tired and
              lethargic for the entire day by entering our aura field and
              penetrating our energy centers. It can hamper the memory, focus
              and concentration part and clogs the vision towards the future
              goal, such energy makes us sick like body pain, cervical pain,
              migraine ,stomach ache and many complicated diseases and disorder
              in other words people say it is spell, evil eye and black magic or
              witchcraft.The energy exchange happens all the time and hence we
              need to shield ourselves and cleanse our energy centers and aura
              with the particular method so that it can protect us and take care
              of us. There are a lot of things which we can achieve through the
              energy exchange like high connection to spirituality, attracting
              health, wealth, success, manifesting our desires and dreams,
              attracting happiness and positivity etc. People are not aware
              about the power of energy they hold as energy is invisible and
              cannot be seen through the eyes but energy plays very important
              role in the development and prosperity of our materialistic life.
              We need to refill our system, cleanse and charge our energy
              centres on daily basis so that we can enjoy the positive vibes and
              good health.
            </p>
            <p>
              Here are various ways to do the energy exchange, Aura and chakra
              cleansing, it can be done through the people around us or we can
              do it with the universal energy present around us. Eshwari
              Niramalikarana Kriya is one among such which has been practiced
              from ancient days and continued culturally and traditionally in
              our and other countries. Eshwari Niramalikarana Kriya is for
              cleansing the body, mind and emotions and in the meantime giving
              strong protection to ourself and our nearer / dearer.

            with natural elements which are great cleansers and energizers of
            the system. The process is completed by running an element along
            certain tracks in the aura to remove impurities caused due to Spell,
            Evil eye and Black magic or any negative exchange of energy.

            improving physical health, helping the body ‘breathe’ better and
            removing negative influences.
