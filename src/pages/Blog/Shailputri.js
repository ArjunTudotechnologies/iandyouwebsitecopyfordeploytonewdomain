              Eshwari Shailaputri (Superficial meaning)
            </h2>
            <p>
              Eshwari Shailaputri is the first manifestation of Goddess Durga.
              She holds a Trishul in one hand and a lotus in the other and rides
              a bull called Nandi. Goddess Parvati was born as the daughter of
              Himalaya and in Sanskrit, Shaila means the mountain, thus she is
              known as Shailaputri.
            </p>
            <h2 className="sub-title">What to offer: </h2>
            <p>
              Devotees offer pure ghee on the foot of Eshwari Shailaputri. It is
              believed that by offering pure ghee the devotees are blessed with
              a life free of diseases and illness.
            </p>
            <h2 className="sub-title">The Antar artha - </h2>
            <p>
              Inner meaning is very simple, Shila means Mountain , mountain
              means stability, stability in the body, stability in the Merudhan
              – Vertebra, one must practice to keep the body and spine erect for
              at least 2.00 to 2.30 hours in comfort and stable physically which
              brings a stability in the mind which results in fine focus, long
              time concentration and it leads to meditation. The Nandi, Bull is
              a symbolic representation of Calmness and Faith, the one who is
              faithful in his/her journey it will develop a strong feeling
              towards Eshwari, this strong feeling when ripe will become liking
              , later when liking ripens it will become one way Love and such
              immense one way Love towards mother Eshwari is called Devotion,
              when Love blossoms, the sadhak will come to know that she(divine
              mother) was the one who was always in Love for me so
              unconditionally, she was the one who guided me always, she was the
              one who protected me from all kinds of problems, she was the one
              who made me meet many people in life, she is doing this for us
              births after births and lives after lives but we are too dumb and
              involved in our own that we often have failed to realize, thanks
              to Sri Guru who aspires into our lives with her blessings (not
              many are blessed with a guru in their lives) just to make us
              realize. She is functioning in our system as 25 + 11 tatvas
              totally 36+01, the +01 is beyond the 36 Tatvas.
