              a bull called Nandi. Goddess Parvati was born as the daughter of
              Himalaya and in Sanskrit, Shail means the mountain, thus she is
              known as Shailputri.

              Faith, the one who is faithful in his/her journey it will develop
              a strong feeling towards Eshwari, a strong feeling when it ripes
              will become liking , later liking when ripened will become one way
              Love such immense one way Love towards mother Eshwari is called
              Devotion, when Love blossoms, the sadhak will come to know that
              she is the one who Loves me so unconditionally, she was the one
              who guided me , she was the one who protected me from all kinds of
              problems, she was the one who made me meet many people in my life,
              she is doing this with us from many lives, from ages but we are
              too dumb who often failed to realize that, thanks to Sri Guru who
              aspired in our lives with her blessings, to make us realize.

              She is functioning in our system as 25 + 11 tatvas totally 36+01,
              the +01 is beyond the 36 Tatvas , Now will see shilaputri
              symbolically, holding the Trident in her hand is the three basic
              instincts of our own being, those are Thinking, Feeling and
              Acting, if one can get clarity in thinking one can be a good Gyana
              yogi , if one can get purity in heart he/she can be a good Bakthi
              yogi, when you bring sincerity in an actions, without expecting
              desirable fruit out of it , he/she can be a good Karma yogi, when
