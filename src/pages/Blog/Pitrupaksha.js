              I often keep telling that our Traditions and Cultures we follow in
              our country are based on Three fundamentals of living they are
              Celebrations, Realization and Liberation, the realization however
              is the way for celebration and liberation.

              The Sri vidhya Tantra and Riligion :
            </h2>
            <p>
              The main goal of spiritual or religious way of living life is for
              liberation when I talk about liberation immediately we think that
              , what is that one is holding us or that which is not allowing us
              to liberate ? then the simple answer, we tell ,it's your Karma! a
              traditional way of answering, then what is karma in reality ? the
              reality of karma is, it's just a Memory, explained in 5 levels, in
              Sri Vidhya Tantra we call them as Pancha Kanchukas - Five types of
              Memories , The memory of Physical ( sensory , short term & Long
              term ) , The memory of Intellect , The memory of emotions, the
              memory which is bound to time and The memory of Elemental (Kala
              Vidhya Raga Kaala & Niyathi ) one needs to Transcend all these
              memories to reach a state which is beyond and free from all such
              karmas or memories The Pithru paksha is not just to liberate the
              departed Soul, its more than that, one need to liberate themselves
              from their own good, bad and ugly memories which are being carried
              in our mind, in the form of Guilt, hatred, fear, anger,
              possessiveness, Liking, Thankfulness and so on. You may be
              thinking that why are good memories also listed here as Karma ?
              Because if one needs to experience and establish oneself in
              Swathantra bhava - Freedom from all kinds of Obligations, Debts,
              Conditions and so on, If you categorize all your memories you can
              put it in two categories , they are Good memories and Bad
              memories, the feeling out of good is felt as a gratitude and out
              of Bad memories you feel sadness, because fundamentally we can
              experience these two - Sadness and Gratitude, even these two are
              also a form of Memories it is said that "Vishayam Sukha Dukham
              vaparithyaja yanthi " Liberation is not only just physical but
              also at the emotional level because the main liberation which
              should happen in the Energy level, that is called final liberation
              also called Mukthi or Moksha
            </p>
            <p>
              So most of our festivals and Rituals are designed based on the
              above mentioned fundamentals, a scientific ritual along with human
              values if you perform any kind of actions , such conscious actions
              are considered as a Kriya or a Leela The Pithru Paksha also among
              them , Rituals are just a science and the Value which we show to
              our Elders and the Ancestors who left us, with Gratitude and
              Forgiveness , Forgiving ourselves to liberate our self from Guilt
              and Forgiving them to Liberate our self from Anger or Hatred, so
              these two Values are what one should carry
            </p>
            <h2 className="sub-title mt-3">Pithru paksha and Deva paksha :</h2>
            <p>
              Pithru Paksha - 15 Days starts from Full moon to New moon during
              Badhrapada masa (During September/October) and is performed with
              sacred rituals as prescribed in the Shastras (ancient book of
              rituals) to pray for peace and to make the departed gain entry
              into higher Lokas and it is prescribed to show gratitude to the
              departed during the Pithru paksha every year, after Pithru paksha
              The Deva Paksha will commence just to Liberate our self from a
              small, Little or Mean, ignorant Mind to a vastly vibrant Universal
              mind.
            </p>
            <h2 className="sub-title mt-3">
              Pithru Paksha in other religions :
            </h2>
            <p>
              Every religion has different types of rituals with different names
              and different procedures but they pray for those departed souls
              and show gratitude every year. So it's our duty and responsibility
              that one should perform the sacred rites during the PitruPaksha .
            </p>
            <p>
              Homage to ancestors is as old as humanity. The belief is found
              worldwide. The Chinese practiced it, so did the ancient Egyptians,
              Greeks, and Romans. . The Jews remember them when they observe
              Passover, the Christians devote the full month of November to
              departed souls, the Muslims pay homage on Shab-e-Barat. The
              Buddhists and the Parsis too have ceremonies to honor their
              ancestors. The Parsi dawn prayer Hosh-Bam recalls the deeds of
              Iranian heroes of old, the names of whom are recited early in the
              morning. Tribal's worship ancestors confined in the forest
              tree-trunks, like the spirit Arial in Shakespeareâ€™s play, The
              Tempest.
