						<p>
							I always say this, our country has one or the other festival
							everyday during the whole year because this country has
							experienced and expounded that this life is for celebration in
							reality life itself is a celebration. This country always stands
							on three principles that this life is for Celebration, Realization
							and Liberation
						</p>
					</Col>
					<Col className="mt-5">
						<p>
							Our festivals are bound with the principles of Achara- Rituals,
							Vichara – Science and Moulya – Values, the rituals are not just
							blind actions there involves science on how to receive energy from
							the Divine source so that our negative energies like negative
							thinking, feeling and word get cleansed and these rituals will
							direct us to doing positive things so that we attract positivity
							to our lives such as happiness, good health, prosperity, success
							and wealth.
						</p>

						<p>
							Just following the rituals will not do enough and so one should
							know the science/Vichara behind it, now that we are heading
							towards Makara Sankranthi Festival, lets know what it is and
							sensibly celebrate the festival, let’s not do it out of
							compulsion.
						</p>

						<p>
							The science behind this festival is that the movement of Sun in
							the Lunisolar calendar of this country is an Astronomical
							calculation of Sun, Moon and other planets' movement, as we know
							that modern science speaks about the two ways of the sun's
							movement, one in to the north hemisphere and the other is to the
							south hemisphere, hope you are aware of this, the same has been
							mention in our scriptures long back as nearly as thousands of
							years ago as, Ayana, if the movement is towards the north
							hemisphere it is called has Uttara Ayana, if It is towards the
							south it is Dakshina Ayana and the same is followed in our lives,
							in our culture, in our traditions, and in our festivals because
							the lunisolar movement has great effects on human consciousness,
							on the mind and the body.
						</p>

						<p>
							In the astronomy followed from our ancient culture it is said to
							be the ‘holy phase of transition’. Transition means Sankranthi,
							every 30 degree out of 360° movement is called one transition or
							Sankranthi and in a year we get 12 such transitions or Sankranthis
							of which two are considered that which transits towards north and
							south, when the south hemispherical (Dakshina Ayana) ends It marks
							the end of an inauspicious phase which according to the Gregorian
							calendar begins around mid-December. It is accepted that any
							auspicious and sacred ritual can be sanctified in any family, this
							day onwards. Scientifically, this day marks the beginning of
							warmer and longer days compared to the nights. In other words,
							Sankranti marks the termination of winter season and beginning of
							a new harvest or spring season, considering these effects of
							Lunisolar system our ancestors have designed particular rituals,
							medicines and values.
						</p>

						<p>
							Let’s see what they are, during the Makara Sankranthi Festival
							concerned to the Lunisolar movement, it says that it is the end of
							Winter season and most of the harvests are completed and the corps
							await further processing, our country is a country of farmers,
							here cultivation is a main and leading profession keeping farmers
							in consideration the rituals of the festivals are being designed.
						</p>

						<p>
							The value behind the ritual is to share and care for others who
							participate during the cultivation, it includes people who
							supplied the fertilizers, those who supplied the pesticides, those
							who worked in the fields, those who provided the water, and even
							the priest of the village irrespective of cast and religion,
							everyone would get the share from the harvest.
						</p>

						<p>
							Let’s check the science behind these rituals and its values, in
							the rituals we pray to the sun god, mother earth and the 7 rivers
							along with the clan deity, it is the way of expressing gratitude
							and thanking along with which they pray for good health,
							prosperity and wealth for the entire village and it's inhabitants.
						</p>

						<p>
							During the Puja(Prayer) they offer the harvested grains to their
							respective clan deity along with it they offer Jaggary and Sesame
							seeds as the main and holy offerings with that they add some
							ground nuts and sugarcane, let’s see why they offer only the above
							mentioned ingredients and the science behind this offerings.
						</p>

						<p>
							As I mentioned before the festival is celebrated during the end of
							winter season, in this season our body develops certain nature
							(Nature as mentioned in ayurveda such as every human body is
							designed with the combination of these 3 main qualities i.e.
							Vata,Pitta and Khapha Nature or Prakruti) called Khapha, which is
							needed to regulate and prepare our body for summer, in the summer,
							Pitta nature will increase to bring the balance in the body, our
							Ayurvedic wisdom speaks a lot about the jaggary and the sesame
							seeds these two ingredients have the medicinal values and
							incredible health benefits. These two nutritious foods occurring
							in nature is made use of and a prayer is made to the clan deity
							for the health and nourishment of everyone as the heat in the
							atmosphere increases after this point in time.
						</p>

						<p>
							In all these preparations, sesame in the form of seed or oil and
							jaggery have a special pride of place, and all for good reason.
						</p>

						<p>
							Sesame seed has immense medicinal value in Ayurveda and is widely
							used as a remedy in herbal formulations as well. It is a healthy
							fat and is highly nutritive. Earlier, cows would be fed sesame oil
							cakes for improved quality of milk and ghee. This has now been
							replaced with groundnut oil cakes. The quality of the milk and
							ghee has suffered for the same reason.
						</p>

						<p>
							Sesame oil provides nourishment and energy to the body, balances
							Vata dosha (air element) and destroys excess of Kapha (earth and
							water element), purifies and brightens the skin and improves
							fertility. It is most beneficial for the treatment of diabetes and
							allied disorders. Sesame is an effective analgesic. Sesame oil had
							known benefits to counter congestion, irregular menstruation, and
							illnesses pertaining to the reproductive organs. This is why
							sesame seeds have been indicated as one of the chief ingredients
							in winter in classical Ayurvedic texts and Shat-tila Ekadashi has
							come to be celebrated since then.
						</p>

						<p>
							Jaggery, that is had with sesame supplies heat and energy to the
							body. We know that anything needs heat to ripen. Similarly, the
							body also needs fuel in order to further process the food
							consumed, to convert it into energy. Jaggery acts as this fuel of
							healthy carbohydrate. Jaggery is a cardio tonic, Jaggery is also
							blood purifier and has the antioxidant property, Jaggery is a good
							source of iron so it helps those with anaemia, Eating jaggery
							reduces joint pain and stiffness .{" "}
						</p>

						<p>
							The value behind this science is they said after eating this
							combination one should speak good, speaking good also means good
							thinking, feeling good and also doing good, they are passing the
							affirmation that one should feel, think, speak and act positively
							with such positiveness one can build a happy family and in turn a
							good society.
						</p>

						<p>
							This festival is not limited to Karnataka state it is celebrated
							with different names all over our country, people celebrate with
							the same ritual, values and the offerings -Nivedhya (Medicinally
							valuable food) with different names while maintaining the same
							essence, the names are.
						</p>

						<p>
							In Andhra Pradesh, Sankranti is known as Pedda Panduga, Makar
							Sankranti in North & Karnataka, Magh Bihu in Assam, Magha Mela in
							the regions of central and north India, Pongal in Tamil Nadu. A
							day prior to Makar Sankranti is Lohri, a harvest festival of
							Punjabi. These are spring festivals, enjoyed with lots of outdoor
							activities that keep up close to Nature and reminds us of how
							closely we are bond with our environment.
						</p>

						<p>
							So the festivals are not just for compulsive celebration, one
							should come out of compulsion, become compassionate and gather the
							knowledge which should be inclusive of proper knowledge about the
							festival, the science behind the rituals and the values added in
							it which plays major role in ours lives.
						</p>

						<p>
							Some belief and history as is said in our scriptures regarding,
							why the name has come to be Sankranthi ?{" "}
						</p>

						<p>
							The story goes something like this, an evil monster named
							Sankarasur used to torture and kill people on Earth without rhyme
							or reason. Goddess Sankranti, on hearing this, landed on Earth and
							killed the devil. The festival of Sankranti is said to be
							celebrated for the downfall of the evil monster Sankarasur.
						</p>

						<p>
							There are many other beliefs that surround this auspicious
							festival. One is that anyone who passes away during Makar
							Sankranti will hold a place in the heaven and will never be
							reborn. This has been mentioned in the greatest epic the
							Mahabharata where Bhishma Pitamaha though wounded from war stayed
							alive until Sankranti so that he could blissfully pass on to
							heaven.
						</p>

						<p>
							Let stories or belief systems say anything but our logic,
							analytical and judgemental mind will not accept this as our minds
							have been educated to find concrete and solid scientific
							explanations.
						</p>

						<p>
							As mentioned in the beginning para our festivals are designed in
							such a way that it considers the Lunisolar movements which affects
							the human consciousness and also on the nature, the medicines are
							used in the form of Nivedhya or holy offerings to the clan deity
							and the values are added to help lead us and bring happiness into
							our families and to the society, such wise method to bring about
							harmony to the society irrespective of cast, creed, community and
							religion must be embraced and passed on to generations which is
							considered as the best method to build healthy, wealthy and
							harmonical society.
						</p>

						<p>
							If you want to realize, want to celebrate life and finally
							liberate yourself then celebrate the festivals sensibly but not
							out of compulsion.
						</p>

						<p>My Makara sankrathi wishes to you and your family.</p>
