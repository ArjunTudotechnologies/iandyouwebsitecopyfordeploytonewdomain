              The ninth or the final day of Navratri is of Eshwari Siddhidhatri.
              She is projected as a four-armed deity sitting on a lotus, holding
              a mace, discus and a book and lotus in her hands. This form of
              Goddess Durga signifies perfection.

            <h2 className="sub-title">What to offer:</h2>
            <p>
              Sesame Seeds are offered to Devi Siddhidatri for safety and
              security from unnatural events
            </p>
            <h2 className="sub-title">The Antar Artha - Inner Meaning :</h2>
            <p>
              Let me tell you a story, story time! - Around the time when the
              universe was just a massive void completely full of darkness,
              there were no indications of the world anywhere. But then a ray of
              divine light, which is ever existing, spread everywhere,
              illuminating each and every nook of the void. This sea of light
              was formless and suddenly it started taking a definite size, and
              finally looked like a Divine Lady, who was none other than Goddess
              Mahashakti herself. The Supreme Goddess came forth and gave birth
              to the Trinity of Gods, Brahma, Vishnu and Mahadev.
            </p>
            <p>
              She advised the three Lords to contemplate to understand their
              roles of performing their duties for the world and imparted her
              knowledge in the form of tantra, they are Rudra yamala , Vishnu
              yamala and Brahma yamala and to her own forms or clones she gave
              Devi yamala tantra now the scriptures are not available in full
              but some are available in textual form, some are preserved by
              words of mouth, some of them we still have them imbibed in our
              culture and traditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Acting on the words of Goddess Mahashakti - Eshwari, Trinities sat
              by the shore of an ocean and performed penances for many years.
            </p>
          </Col>
          <Col md={12} className="mt-5">
            <p>
              The pleased Goddess appeared before them in the form of
              Siddhidhatri. She bestowed boons upon them, she created her two
              clone they are visnu's and Bramha's wives in the forms of
              Saraswati and Lakshmi, Goddess Adi parasakti was born as sati and
              was reborn as Parvatii. Eshwari Siddhidhatri entrusted Brahma to
              take up the role as the creator of worlds, Vishnu with the role of
              preserving the creation and its creatures, and Mahadev with the
              role of destroying the worlds when it is time, Devi is the one who
              witnesses at the time of destruction, she is also called Maha
              Pralaya Sakshini.
            </p>
            <p>
              She tells them that their powers are in the forms of their
              respective wives, who will help them perform their tasks. The
              Goddess assures them that she will also provide to them, divine
              miraculous powers, which will also help them to carry out their
              duties. Saying this, she bestowed to them eight supernatural
              powers, which are named Anima, Mahima, Garima, Laghima, Prapti,
              Prakambya, Ishitva and Vashitva.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is the story of the creation in Devi Purana but will see how
              she is still performing in our existence.
            </p>
            <p>
              The meaning of her name - Siddhi means supernatural psychic powers
              and ability to Meditate and Dhatri means giver, she fulfills all
              the divine aspirations. According to Vedic scriptures, Lord Shiva
              attained all the siddhis by worshiping Siddhidatri Siddhidatri who
              sitting on Lotus, the eight petal lotus is symbolized as female
              principle - Shakthi, which is above the senses, Manas - Mind,
              Budhi - Intellect and Ahankara - Ego ,which is the active
              principle of the manifestation, together the male - shiva , which
              is passive principle, they are not separate and they are together,
              they both are not the same but they are not two in the meantime
              they are both one, it is very difficult to explain, so having
              realized which, I compiled the organization name ‘I and You Being
              together’, we are all not same but we can lead lives together, in
              subtle reality we are one .
            </p>
            <p>
              In the same context Shiva- a Passive principle of the
              consciousness and Shakthi- the active state of consciousness are
              both not the same but they are together. They are together as if
              both are one, because this is the absolute transcendental state of
              consciousness so I keeping mentioning in most of my talks that -
              <b>
                Shiva is static Shakti consciousness and Shakti is dynamic Shiva
                consciousness
              </b>{" "}
              - This is what Samayachara means.
            </p>
            <p>
              Holding Mace, Discuss and the Book symbolizes that liberation from
              dualities, inaction in action and action in inaction, knowledge
              and freedom is Sarva Swatantra.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Siddhidatri is that state of Eshwari Consciousness where the
              perceiver of this state is no other than You, the real you, not at
              all your limited ego identity, it is something that which is not -
              Śhiva Himself , in the other eight levels, the state is one thing
              and the perceiver is something else.
            </p>

            <p>So it is said in Sree Lalitha Sahasranamam Stotra</p>

              In the Sahasranama Lord Hayagriva - Sri vidhya Guru, tried his
              best to convey the reality of Absolute Eshwari -Consciousness in
              his own words to Muni Agasthya.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this final state, the state is Śhiva and the perceiver is also
              Śhiva, a absolute union with the Universal Transcendental
              consciousness.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is nothing outside Śhiva, this state is completely filled
              with consciousness, bliss, will, knowledge, and action in
              inaction.
            </p>
            <p>
              In one word Siddhidatri is Parabrahma Tatva, I with love call her
              as Eshwari, my Mother a Cosmic mother, she blessed me to see the
              world from her point of view, she made me see the world in three
              dimensions and they are:-
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                01. Accept and perceive Things, Person and the Situations as
                they are
              </li>
              <li>02. Recognizing Love behind all kinds of emotion and</li>
              <li>03. Feeling of Energy in each and every object and lives.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The 3rd one is a bit difficult but possible through sadhana, that
              which I impart in the Non - religious format, starting from
              Eshwari kriya to Eshwari Sri Vidhya Sadhana.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let me summarize the journey which is Non- Religious and essence
              of all religious faiths and practices, if you observe a journey
              from your physical stability, austerity to develop disciplined
              mind and balanced emotions, then comes cultivating the mind
              towards the absolute by performing Tapasya through Manah
              prakshalya methods and Akarshana Sidhanta Methods, the first five
              are objective journey towards the absolute reality and the
              remaining three are subjective journey which is possible only with
              the blessings and guidance of Sri Guru, those are Kalarathri ,
              Mahagauri and Siddhidatri , now comes the tenth day .
            </p>
            <p>
              The tenth day is meant for Introspection, Measurement,
              Self-analysis and valuation of our own progress comparatively to
              the previous year of practice, then be it good progress or no
              progress at all surrender it to Eshwari, take a vow to increase
              efforts from your end and for that seek the blessings from her and
              Celebrate, so this day is called Vijaya Dashami, the tenth day is
              a day for celebrating the victory over evil or demons within.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              The Navaratri is not only a Celebration, it is a process towards
              Realization and to accomplish Liberation.{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              I wish you on this Deva Paksha that May Eshwari bless you and your
              family with Wealth, Health, Happiness, Progress, Prosperity and
              Success in both Spiritual and Mundane planes.
