            <p>
              The ninth or the final day of Navarathri is of Goddess
              Siddhidhatri. She is projected as a four-armed deity sitting on a
              lotus, holding a mace, discus and a book and lotus in her hands.
              This form of Goddess Durga signifies perfection.
            </p>
            <h2 className="sub-title">What to offer:</h2>
            <p>
              Sesame Seeds are offered to Devi Siddhidatri for safety and
              security from unnatural events.
            </p>
            <h2 className="sub-title">The Antar Artha - Inner Meaning :</h2>
            <p>
              let me tell you a story, Now is a story time - Around the time
              when the universe was just a massive void completely full of
              darkness, there were no indications of the world anywhere. But
              then a ray of divine light, which is ever existing, spread
              everywhere, illuminating each and every nook of the void. This sea
              of light was formless. Suddenly, it started taking a definite
              size, and finally looked like a Divine Lady, who was none other
              than Goddess Mahashakti herself. The Supreme Goddess came forth
              and gave birth to the Trinity of Gods, Brahma, Vishnu and Mahadev.
            </p>
          </Col>
          <Col md={12}>
            <p>
              She advised the three Lords to contemplate to understand their
              roles of performing their duties for the world and Imparted her
              knowledge in the form of Tantra , they are Rudra yamala , Vishnu
              yamala and Brahma yamala to her own two form or clone she gave
              Devi yamala tantra now the scriptures are not available in full
              but by words of mouth still in our culture and traditions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Acting on the words of Goddess Mahashakti - Eshwari, Trinities sat
              by the bank of an ocean and performed penances for many years.
            </p>
            <p>
              The pleased Goddess appeared before them in the form of
              Siddhidhatri. She bestowed upon them, she created Her clones
              Bramha,Vishnu and Mahadeva's wives in the forms of Saraswati,
              Lakshmi and Goddess Adi parasakti born as sati and reborn as
              Parvatii. Goddess Siddhidhatri entrusted Brahma to take up the
              role as the creator of worlds, Vishnu with the role of preserving
              the creation and its creatures, and Mahadev with the role of
              destroying the worlds when it is time.
            </p>
            <p>
              She tells them that their powers are in the forms of their
              respective wives, who will help them perform their tasks. The
              Goddess assured them that she will also provide to them, divine
              miraculous powers, which will also help them carry out their
              duties. Saying this, she bestowed to them eight supernatural
              powers, in which they were named Anima, Mahima, Garima, Laghima,
              Prapti, Prakambya, Ishitva and Vashitva.
            </p>
            <p>
              this is the story of the creation in Devi Purana but will see how
              she is still performing in our existence.
            </p>
            <p>
              The meaning of her name - Siddhi means supernatural Psychic power
              and an ability to meditate and Dhatri means giver, she fulfills
              all the divine aspirations. According to Vedic scriptures, Lord
              Shiva attained all the siddhis by worshiping Siddhidatri
            </p>
            <p>
              Siddhidatri who sitting on Lotus , the eight petaled lotus
              symbolized as female principle - Shakthi, which is above the five
              senses , Manas - Mind, Budhi - Intellect and Ahankara - Ego ,which
              is the active principle of the manifestation, together male -
              shiva , which is passive principle, they are not separate, they
              are together, they both are not same but they are not two, mean
              time they both are one, it is very difficult to explain, So I
              decided on the organisation name as I and You Being together
              because we are not the same but we can lead lives together.
            </p>
            <p>
              In same context Shiva- a Passive principle of the consciousness
              and Shakthi- an active state of consciousness, they both are not
              the same but they are together, as if both are one , because this
              is the absolute transcendental state of consciousness, So I keep
              telling always that - Shiva is static Shakti consciousness and
              Shakti is dynamic Shiva consciousness - This is what Samayachara
              means.
            </p>
            <p>
              Holding Mace, Discus and the book is symbolizes that liberation
              from dualities, inaction in action and action in inaction ,
              knowledge and freedom which is Sarva Swatantra.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Siddhidatri is that state of Eshwari Consciousness and the
              observer of this state is none other than You, the real you, not
              at all your ego identity , that state is something that which is
              not - Śhiva Himself. In the other eight levels, the state is one
              thing and the perceiver is something else.
            </p>
            <p>So it is said in Sree Lalitha Sahasranamam Stotra</p>

              In the Sahasranama Hayagriva rishi tried his best to convey the
              reality of Absolute Eshwari -Consciousness in his own words to
              Muni Agasthya
            </p>
            <p>
              In this final state, the state is Śhiva and the perceiver is also
              Śhiva, an absolute union with the universal consciousness.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is nothing outside of Śhiva, this state is completely filled
              with consciousness, bliss, will, knowledge, and action in inaction
              .
            </p>
            <p>
              In one word Siddhidatri is Parabrahma tatva, I with love call her
              as Eshwari, my Mother, Cosmic mother who blessed me to see the
              world in her point of view, she made me see it in three dimension,
              they are:-
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                01. Accept and Perceive Things, Person and the Situations as
                they are
              </li>
              <li>
                02. Recognizing Love behind all kinds of emotions and the 3rd
                one is a bit difficult but possible
              </li>
              <li>03. Feeling Energy in all objects and lives </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              That which I am imparting to the aspirants in the Non - religious
              format, from Eshwari kriya to Eshwari Sri Vidhya Sadhana.
            </p>
            <p>
              Let me summarize the journey which is Non- Religious and Essence
              of all Religious faith and practices, if you observe a journey
              from your physical stability, Austerity to develop disciplined
              mind and balanced emotions, then comes cultivating the mind
              towards the absolute by performing Tapasya through Manah
              prakshalya methods and Akarshana Sidhanta, the above five is for
              objective journey towards the absolute reality, rest three is for
              subjective journey which is possible with blessings and guidance
              of Sri Guru, those are Kalarathri , Mahagauri and Siddhidatri ,
              now comes the tenth day .
