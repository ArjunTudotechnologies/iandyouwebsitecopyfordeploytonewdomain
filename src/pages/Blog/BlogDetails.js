                Most of us are unaware of the real meaning of Ganesha and his
                role in our life, most of us have been happy listening the
                stories and followed Celebration as an obligation, we do not
                celebrate any of our festivals because we have taken them as
                commitments or social compulsion.

              A thought came by that made me write something which is of our
              culture and tradition, more than that it is inheriting the
              instinct of our nation, this nation is a land of people who always
              wanted to explore the life, Cosmos and the Absolute, later they
              imparted the experience to their sincere seekers.
            </p>
            <p>
              This land is always focused on three factors, they have realized
              that the life is for Celebration , Realization and for Liberation,
              so most of our festivals are based on{" "}
              <b>Rituals or Celebrations, Yogic knowledge and Human Values,</b>{" "}
              even Ganesha festival is also one among them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ganesha Chaturthi is a Birth day celebration of Lord Ganesha, here
              I am mentioning some points out of Purana, Tantra and from the
              Vedic point of View.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>As per Puranas,</b> There are two different versions about
              Ganesha's birth Legend tells the tale of Goddess Parvati who made
              baby Ganesha using sandalwood paste and asked him to guard the
              entrance while she took a bath. When Lord Shiva wanted to enter,
              Ganesha would not even allow him to pass through. Lord Shiva,
              enraged by this, severed the child’s head. When Goddess Parvati
              realised what had happened, she was overwhelmed and heartbroken.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is when Lord Shiva promised that he would bring baby Ganesha
              back to life. He went on to instruct his followers (ganas) to
              search for the head of the first living creature they could find
              to replace on Ganesha’s body.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, the ganas could only find a baby elephant’s head. That is
              how Lord Ganesha came back to life with the head of an elephant.
              Lord Shiva named him the leader of the ganas, or Ganapati.
            </p>
            <p>
              The other legend has it that Ganesha was created by Shiva and
              Parvati on request of the Devas, to be a vighnakartaa
              (obstacle-creator) in the path of rakshasas (demonic beings), and
              a vighnahartaa (obstacle-averter) to help the Devas.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>On health,</b> Our culture is so rich by its nature because the
              Nivedhya- Offerings which we keep in front of the Lord is nothing
              but Ayurveda based knowledge for our good health, the Modak or
              Kadabu which we prepare is has common ingredients such as Sesame
              seeds and Jaggery. <b>Sesame</b> oil provides nourishment and
              energy to the body, balances Vata dosha (air element) and destroys
              excess of Kapha (earth and water element), purifies and brightens
              the skin and improves fertility, <b>Jaggery</b> that is had
              with sesame supplies heat and energy to the body
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Black sesame seeds</b> are a good source of energy due to the
              high fat they contain healthy fats like polyunsaturated fatty
              acids & Omega-6 they also contain fiber, iron, calcium, magnesium
              and phosphorus.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Social and cultural</b> point of view, Celebrations are energy
              boosters, a way to experience Happiness, sharing, Caring, Unity in
              family, unity in society and to balance socio economics, moreover
              to spread human values, you find the same even in our history but,
              it is unknown when the festivals started. It became a major social
              and public event with sponsorship of Shivaji after Mughal-Maratha
              wars. It became popular again in the 19th century after public
              appeal by Indian freedom fighter Lokmanya Tilak, who championed it
              as a means to circumvent the colonial British government ban on
              Hindu gatherings through its anti-public assembly legislation in
              1892.
            </p>
            <p>
              <b>Yoga tantra</b> point of view, Ganesha has eight forms and one
              more is the occult form known as Astha and Ucchishta Gaṇapati,
              which moreover signifies a Yogic tantric spiritual based yogic
              practice, would like to give some short notes on the same.
            </p>
            <p>
              let's start from Astha Ganapati, the first form is
              <b>Vakratunda</b> (twisted trunk) an embodiment of the Absolute
              Impersonal aspect of Godhood called Brahman in the form of
              Ganesha, A demon named <b>Matsara -Envy</b>, was born out of the
              Pramaada - Madness of Indra, the king of Gods
            </p>
            <p>
              The second one is <b>Ekadanta</b> , it was in the form of Ekadanta
              (single tusked) who defeated the demon{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Madusura – Pleasure “Eka stands for Maya the “embodied”. and Danta
              for Truth (Satta). Thus Ekadanta represents the Supreme Truth
              which wields the Maya
            </p>
            <p>
              Mahodara The third form was of Mahodara who vanquished Mohasura,
              the demon of Delusion and Confusion it means lack of clear
              perception{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Gajanana Equally perplexing in the tangled web
              of intergenerational sexuality is the next tale, of the avatar of
              Gajanana or Gajavaktra who defeated the demon Lobhasura- Greed
              or Covetousness
            </p>
            <p>
              Lambhodara Lord Vishnu had assumed the form of Mohini, the
              enchantress, to delude the demons, When Lord Shiva beheld
              this seductive,Shiva became sad and angry. Out of the seeds of
              His disappointment was born a terrible demon Krodhasura., Lord
              Ganesha in the form of Lambodara, appeared before them to subdue
              Krodhasura – Angry{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Vikata who subdued Kama, the demon of desire. The demon named
              Kamasura, i.e. the embodiment of lust.
            </p>
            <p>
              Vighnaraja a very unusual mode of conveyance – a Sheshnaag,In this
              lifetime Ganesha managed to subdue the demon Mamasur ,also known
              as Mamtasur or Mama means I'ness the demon of the ego, This is
              Ganesha’s most popular form, known as The Remover of Obstacles
            </p>
            <p>
              Dhoomravarna Ganesha has a mouse as his mount here. His life
              mission this time around was to defeat the demon Ahamkarasur, the
              demon of self infatuation or Aham{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              ‘Aham’ married ‘Mamata’, daughter of ’Pramadasura’ and begot two
              sons in her named ‘Garva’ and ‘Sreshta’ Tired of the demonic rule
              of Aham, the Devas meditated upon Lord Ganesha for salvation, and
              the Lord descended to their rescue-Lord Ganesha in the form
              of Dhoomravarna subdued the demon Aham
            </p>
            <p>
              When self infatuation unites with Ego it results in Pride and
              being The best, everthing is born out of Ignorance and Ego, Lord
              Ganesha is a such Awareness which destroys demon Aham{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Tantric Ganesha Uchishta Ganapath form is that his hasta is at the
              yoni of his Shakti, Neela Sarasvati, playing with it whose abode
              is Neela Parvata. She is playing with his Linga- phallus. This
              form is meditated on after dusk in the evening Uch + sista =
              uchista means the ultimate
            </p>
            <p>
              Ganpathi helps to cross over obstacles He gives knowledge.  His
              shakthi is neelsaraswati, she gives complete knowledge of any
              Vidya she is Vidya rajni. She is pleased thru yoni puja. Her yoni
              - vagina means Path way towards source of creation{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              He is making love to his partner Neela Saraswathi with his trunk
              Uchishta Ganapathy is called great, because he does not reject
              anything as puja. He does not judge, this is good and this is bad
              Up to a point, the paths of Srividya and Uchishta Ganapathy go
              parallel; they accept sexuality and sensuality as sacred offerings
              When it comes to insults, they diverge. This is the difference
              Since Uchishta Ganapathy accepts vulgarity and even insults as his
              being. Erotic play is the best worship to Uchishta Ganapathy{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              Science and Physiology the lobes, brainstem and spinal cord of the
              human body bears a remarkable resemblance to Ganesh's ears and
              trunk.
            </p>
            <p>Ganesha in the Physiology </p>
            <p>
              Ganesha is one of the sons of Shiva and Parvati. He is said to sit
              at the entrance to Shiva's cave, and nothing can go in or out
              without passing him. Within the physiology there is a set of
              structures that form the gateway to the brain. These are the pons,
              the medulla, and the cerebellum. No information goes to the brain
              or comes out of it without passing through, or communicating with,
              this set of structures. In their function they exactly represent
              the same functions ascribed to Ganesha. Together these structures
              also look exactly like Ganesha face, It is noteworthy that in the
              Vedic Literature, Rishi Vyâsa dictated the Mahâbhârat to Ganesha,
              asking him to compare sound and meaning, which is similar to the
              ability of the cerebellum to compare intention and action. In the
              case of the physiology, Vyâsa represents speech centres of the
              brain, and Ganesh is the structure that makes speech 'visible', or
              gives a form to sound. This is the writing aspect, which involves
              the use of motor nerves and aspects of control and coordination of
              action that also go through the structures in our physiology
              representing Ganesh. So Ganesha is our very available receiving
              and storing abilities of the consciousness which represents
              occipital lobe, medulla oblongata and spinal cord{" "}
            </p>
            <p>
              As I said earlier this land is always focused on three factors,
              they are - life is for Celebration , Realization and for
              Liberation, Most of us have forgotten the main two points
              Realization and Liberation and we are just focusing only on
              Celebration, now that has also become a kind of social compulsion.
              If one really wants to Celebrate Lord Ganesha's true birthday then
              he/she needs to focus on the inner hidden meaning behind this
              festival that is spiritual.
            </p>
            <p>
              Spiritual point of view, To lead a Spiritual, Material life or the
              Holistic way of life, one must have Intelligence, Clarity, Lucid
              Perception and abilities for the removal of obstacles, for that
              one need to look Inwards and need to develop such awareness which
              can notice and remove the reason or cause for our sufferings and
              which creates obstacle in our path towards success, those
              obstacles are termed as Demons in purana but they are our own
              Anger, Lust, Greediness, Attachments, Pride, Envy , Ignorance and
              Ego. Ganesha is an such awareness of our own consciousness which
              can notice and is capable to removal of obstacles. Ganesha is the
              lord for Psychic abilities in our awareness like Knowledge, Clear
              perception, Clarity, Memory and the ability to handle Insults,
              Defame and Vulgarity, and the sense to accept opposite values.
              Gana means groups and Esha means the Lord , the birth of the
              various groups of intelligence as mentioned above, in one's self
              is the real birth of Ganesha, and showing gratitude towards the
              Guru or God is the Celebration, it is a celebration of Realization
              and that dimension of our life is termed as Ganesha. So Ganesha
              festival is for Celebration , Realization and Liberation as are
              the other festivals.
