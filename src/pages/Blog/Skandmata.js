            <p>
              Goddess Skandmata who is worshipped on the fifth day is also known
              as Panchami, as Lalita Panchami in some places. Skandmata is a
              four-armed deity, who carries a lotus in two of her arms with a
              sacred Kamandalu and a bell in the other two. She also carries a
              little Kartikeya on her lap and because of this Kartikeya is also
              known as Skanda. She is seated on a lotus.

              Skanda Mata - Is such energy which is capable to give birth to our
              Will and Wish - Sankalpa which is in the form of Thoughts or
              Emotions or in Subtler form as Intentions - Iccha
            </p>
            <p>
              The energy which gives birth or makes it Materialize Intentions -
              Sankalpa of the Sadhaks

              The Intentions be it Material or Spiritual, it can be Bhoga or
              Moksha, what we sow she will make it reap or in other dimension,
              what you sow so shall you reap, The abilities to materialize
              Intention is Devi, that Shakthi or Energy, has been symbolized as
              two Lotuses in both her hands which denotes both Bhoga and Moksha,
              Material and Spiritual attainments as said in{" "}
              <b>/RudraYamala - Bhogas cha Mokshas cha Kara scha yeva/</b> any
              kind of intentions, one can materialize, the intention and the
              energy to materialize is the divine mother, let it be good , bad
              or ugly the result is what you sow that you will reap, as per
              Karma sidhanta of Sage Kapila, some part of events and incidents
              are pre-determined, most parts of the events and incidents are
              based on your freewill, both Prarabdha and Varthamana karmas are
              nothing but your Intentions - thoughts and feelings, so one should
              have good Intentions, for that they need develop alertness and
              awareness.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bell and Kamandalu in her hands indicates alertness and
              awareness, when one has well trained mind or is Good in Tapasya,
              they can generate good intentions , good thoughts and good
              emotions with that they can lead good life, a meaningful life, an
              example setting life or a Holistic life.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the sadhak follows the System (Dharma) or a Religious faith
              let it be of any Religion the grace and blessings of Divine Mother
              Kushmanda will bless them according to their Intentions, the
              energy will bless them with Creative thoughts, Intuitive Thoughts
              and well balanced emotions, with that, one can lead a Holistic way
              of life .
            </p>
            <p>
              Someone might think, then why should she bless those whose
              intentions are bad or ugly , Sinful or Violent or terror filles
              for that, my answer, Opposite values complement each other so yoga
              tantra says there is no good and no bad, it doesn't means that you
              can commit sin, one should remember that what you commit you will
              get it back, so a sadhak must dispose the good and bad memories,
              or surrender it to Devi or Guru, for this, one need to pratice
              Manah Prakshalya -{" "}

              There are many ways to communicate, in other way, there are many
              ways to generate our intentions, both are same, The Rig-vedha and
              yogic traditions have given very profound way to communicate with
              Godhood, so the Yoga Tantra of Sri Vidhya Samaya Traditions says
              there are four ways to communicate with the Godhood or materialize
              our Intentions, thoughts and emotions.

              The energy which is capable of giving birth to our
              Intentions(Spanda) and make it materialize such Personified energy
              is called Skanda Mata, I with Love and great reverence personally
              call her Spanda Mata .

              From Here onwards the journey of the sadhak will become very
              subjective, It is subjective because it is very subtle in nature,
              to experience this one needs blessings of Guru, a Sri guru can
              bless you and can guide you, so his presence is needed very badly,
              only a Guru can guide you towards the absolute.
            </p>
            <p>
              So faith on Sri guru and his Guru Parampara is a must to take up
              in this subjective journey, so every sadhak is instructed to
              perform Guru Puja on every Thursdays and full moon day so that one
              can get his holy blessings.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Katyayani, Kalaratri and Maha Gauri they are three states of
              our own consciousness which is subjective in nature, I can make
              you experience but I cannot guarantee you that I will make you
              understand through my explanation, that too explanation through
              words is highly impossible, words cannot do justice but still will
              try my best and keep it simple as I have made attempts to explain
              in my previous posts, you may ask why it is difficult to explain,
              Is this is a Rocket science ? I would say, it is not, it is
              difficult to explain because it is subjective, very subjective in
              nature, hope you understand what subjective means, Rocket science
              is a Objective approach, hope you learnt from the point made here.
            </p>
            <p>
              So one can experience these further states only with regular
              practice of Eshwari Sadhana and Eshwari Dhyana, for a common
              person it is impossible to experience, let's now see her existence
              in our existential reality.
