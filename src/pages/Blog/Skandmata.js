            <p>
              Goddess Skandmata who is worshipped on the fifth day is also known
              as Panchami. Skandmata is a four-armed deity, who carries a lotus
              in two of her arms with a sacred Kamandalu and a bell in the other
              two. She also carries a little Kartikeya on her lap and because of
              this Kartikeya is also known as Skanda. She is seated on a lotus.

              <b>The Antar artha - Inner Meaning :</b>
              Skanda Mata - Is such energy which is capable to give birth to our
              Will and Wish which are in the forms of Thoughts or Emotions or in
              Subtler form as Intentions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The energy which gives birth or makes a sadhak to Materialize
              his/her Intentions
            </p>
            <p>
              The Intentions be it Material or Spiritual, it can be Bhoga or
              Moksha, what we sow she will make it reap or in other dimension,
              what you sow so shall you reap.
            </p>
            <p>
              The two Lotuses in her hands symbolizes both Bhoga and Moksha-
              Material and Spiritual attainments as said in /RudraYamala:-
              Bhogas cha Mokshascha Karaschaiva/ The sadhak can materialize
              both.
            </p>

            <p>
              The two Lotuses in both her hands symbolizes both Bhoga and
              Moksha, Material and Spiritual attainments as said in{" "}
              <b>/RudraYamala - Bhogas cha Mokshas cha Kara scha yeva/</b> The
              sadhak can materialize both.
            </p>
            <p>
              The bell and Kamandalu indicates alertness and awareness, when one
              has well trained mind or is Good in Tapasya, he / she can generate
              good intentions , good thoughts and good emotions with that they
              can lead good life, a Holistic life.
            </p>
            <p>
              The grace and blessings of Divine Mother Kushmanda will give Birth
              to Creative thoughts, Intuitive Thoughts and well balanced
              emotions with that one can lead a Holistic way of life .
            </p>
            <p>
              So the Yoga tantra of Sri Vidhya Samaya Traditions says there are
              four ways to communicate with the Godhood or materialize our
              Intentions, thoughts and emotions.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are mentioned very well in Sree Lalita Sahasranama Stotra

              The energy which is capable of giving birth to our
              Intentions(Spanda) and make it materialize such Personified energy
              is called Skanda Mata, I with great reverence personally call her
              Spanda Mata .

            <p>
              From Here onwards the journey of the sadhak will become very
              subjective, here one needs blessings of Guru, a Sri guru can bless
              you and can guide you, so his presence is needed very badly, only
              a Guru can guide you towards the absolute,faith on Sri guru and
              his Guru Parampara is a must, so every sadhak is instructed to
              perform Guru Puja on every full moon day so that one can get his
              holy blessings.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Katyayani, Kalaratri and Maha Gauri they are three states of
              our own consciousness which is subjective in nature,I can make you
              to experience but I cannot guarantee you that I will make you to
              understand through my explanation, that too explanation through
              words is highly impossible, words cannot do justice but still will
              try my best and keep is simple as I have made attempts to explain
              in my previous posts, why it is difficult to explain because it is
              subjective, very subjective in nature.
            </p>
            <p>
              One can experience these further states only with regular practice
              of Eshwari Sadhana and Eshwari Dhyana for common person it is
              impossible to experience, let's now see her existence in our
              existential reality.
