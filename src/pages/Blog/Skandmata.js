            <p>
              Eshwari Skandmata who is worshipped on the fifth day is also known
              as Panchami, Lalita Panchami at some places. Skandmata is a
              four-armed deity, who carries a lotus in two of her arms with a
              sacred Kamandalu and a bell in the other two. She also carries a
              little Kartikeya on her lap and because of this Kartikeya is also
              known as Skanda. She is seated on a lotus.

            <p>Bananas are the favorite fruit of Eshwari Skandmata.</p>
            <h2 className="sub-title">The Antar artha - Inner Meaning :</h2>
            <p>
              Skandamata is such energy which is capable of giving birth to our
              will and wishes - Sankalpa which are in the forms of Thoughts or
              Emotions or in Subtler form as Intentions - Iccha The energy which
              gives birth or makes it to Materialize is Intentions - Sankalpa of
              the Sadhaks.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Intentions be it Material or Spiritual, it can be Bhoga or
              Moksha, what we sow she will make it reap or poetically what you
              sow so shall you reap, the abilitiy to materialize Intentions is
              Devi, that Shakthi or Energy has been symbolized like two Lotuses
              in both her hands which symbolizes both Bhoga and Moksha, Material
              and Spiritual attainments as said in/Rudrayamala - Bhogas cha
              Mokshas cha Karascha yeva/ any kind of intentions can be
              materialized, the intentions and the energy to materialize is
              divine mother, be it good , bad or ugly the result is, what you
              sow so shall you reap, as per Karma sidhanta of Sage Kapila, some
              part of events and incidents are pre-determined, rest of the
              events and incidents are based on your freewill, both Prarabdha
              and Varthamana karmas are nothing but your own Intentions
              -thoughts and feelings, so one should have good Intentions, for
              that they need alertness and awareness.

            <p>
              The bell and Kamandalu in her hands indicates alertness and
              awareness, when one has well trained mind or is Good in Tapasya,
              they can generate good intentions , good thoughts and good
              emotions with that they can lead good life, a meaningful life, a
              life that sets example or a Holistic life.
            </p>
            <p>
              When the sadhak follows the System (Dharma) or a Religious faith
              be it of any Religion the grace and blessings of Divine Mother
              Kushmanda will bless them according to their Intentions, the
              energy will bless them with creative thoughts, intuitive thoughts
              and well balanced emotions with that one can lead a Holistic way
              of life. Someone might think, then why should she bless those
              whose intentions are bad or ugly , Sinful or Violent or
              terrorizing, for that my answer is ‘Opposite values are complement
              each other’ so yoga tantra says there is no good and no bad, it
              doesn't mean that you can commit sin, one should remember that
              what you commit you will get it back, so a sadhak must dispose
              both good and bad memories, or surrender it to Devi or Guru, for
              this one need to pratice Manah Prakshalya - Vishaya sukham
              dukhavat parityajam: YSU-9
            </p>
            <p>
              There are many ways to communicate or in another way of looking at
              it, there are many ways to generate our intentions, both are same,
              In Rigveda and yogic traditions, it has given very profound ways
              to communicate with Godhood, so the Yoga Tantra of Sri Vidhya
              Samaya Tradition says there are four ways to communicate with
              Godhood or to materialize our intentions, thoughts and emotions.
            </p>
            <p>
              They are mentioned very well in Sree Lalita Sahasranama Stotra

              The energy which is capable of giving birth to our
              Intentions(Spanda) and make it materialize such Personified energy
              is called Skanda Mata, I with Love and great reverence personally
              call her Spanda Mata.

              From Here onwards the journey of the sadhak will become very
              subjective, It is subjective because it is very subtle in nature,
              to experience this one needs blessings of Guru, a Sri guru can
              bless you and can guide you, so his presence is needed very badly,
              only a Guru can guide you towards the absolute. So faith on Sri
              guru and his Guru Parampara is a must to take on this subjective
              journey, so every sadhak is instructed to perform Guru Puja on
              every Thursdays and full moon days so that one can get his holy
              blessings.
            </p>

            <p>
              Katyayani, Kalaratri and Maha Gauri are three states of our own
              consciousness which is subjective in nature, I can make you to
              experience but I cannot guarantee you that I will make you
              understand through my explanation, that too through explanation by
              words is highly impossible, words cannot do justice but still will
              try my best and keep it simple as I have made attempts to explain
              in my previous posts. You may ask why is it difficult to explain,
              is this is Rocket science ? for which I would say, it is not, why
              then is it difficult to explain, because it is subjective, very
              subjective in nature, hope now you understand what subjective
              means, Rocket science is an Objective approach to creating one,
              hoping you understood my point of view. So one can experience
              these further states only with regular practice of Eshwari Sadhana
              and Eshwari Dhyana but, for common person it is impossible to
              experience, let's now see her existence in our existential
              reality.
