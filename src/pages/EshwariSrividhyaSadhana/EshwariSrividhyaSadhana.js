                <b>Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana samaya</b> arose as part of great
                Shakta tradition of Yoga Tantra which considers Shakti the
                Universal energy in feminine form to be the Supreme object for
                Knowledge , Practice and Devotion.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since this sadhana is so sacred, it is said that the King of the
                Gods – Indra and Maaya will be watching over you. Let go of your
                ego. All Devas (Gods) respect a Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhak as
                much as they respect Lord Bhirava / Bhiravi .
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus a sadhak who meditates daily, if at all encounters a
                difficulty, he does not fight it alone. The whole universe
                fights with him as Divine protective energy which is always
                around him.

                It is said in the scriptures that

                like Lord Bhirava, Lord Narayana, Lord Bramha and his sons,

                knowledge of the self and Universe, It's the Mantra, Tantra and
                Yantra Sadhana.
              </p>
              <p>
                It is said that after many births, through the great merits
                which one carries in this present birth, such a fortune person
                can only come across a Guru/Master who can initiate them to
                <b>Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana.</b>
              </p>
              <p>
                To put it in simple terms, basically Sri Vidhya Eshwari sadhana
                is a deeksha of supreme order given by a self realized guru, in
                which you are taught how to connect with the Cosmic
                consciousness or Eshwari consciousness. Sadhak will be taught to
                meditate upon the Nine + Two energy centers , which is generally
                known as Navavarana Sadhana
              </p>
              <p>
                Lord Shiva or Parameshwara is the first Guru who taught this
                vidhya in the form of
                <b>Lord Anandha Bhirava & Lord Dakshinamurthi,</b> Lord Narayana
                in the form of Lord Hayagriva, the above are the three main
                traditions in Srividhya, from them it passed on to Saptha
                rishis, Sanaka rishis, Nandikeshwara, Dattatreya , Parashuram,
                Agastya Mahamuni, Ma Lopamudra and so on...
              </p>
              <p>
                Sri Vidhya was also passed down to a worthy disciple through
                guru-shishya sampradaya / Master and disciple relationship,
                Later bhagavan Adi Shankaracharya re-established Sri Vidhya
                after culmination of all three forms of the sadhana viz kaadi,
                haadi and saadi vidhya into one single form.
              </p>
              <p>
                Sri Vidhya sadhana is known to be taught via 3 methods such as
                Kaulavachara, Mishra and Samayachara
              </p>
              <p>
                The Kaulavachara is more over external ritual based way of
                worship , in Mishra both external and internal method of worship
                but the
                <b>
                  Samayachara is totally a internal subjective scientific
                  journey towards the absolute

                ( Lalita sahasra nama ; verse 162, //Antharmukha samaradhya
                Bahirmukha sudurlabha// )
              </p>
              <p>
                Sri Vidhya sadhana has two methods of Practice, Dual/ Dvaita and
                Non-Dual Advaita. Dvaita sadhana is ritual based practice, hence
                it follows ritualistic approach through Puja, Archana and
                Havana, etc. Advaita is non-dualistic which is non-ritualistic
                or Samayachara, The worshipper finds the one being worshipped
                within self, the great sage Guru Adi Shankaracharya has taught
                both methods of practice to different sections of society or
                Varna.

                <b>Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana (SVES)</b> is a method of Samaya
                Achara, the method of Non-dual or Monistic way of practice based
                on Ancient yogic tantra, most methods of practice are being

                The word Samayachara means the conduct as described in the
                Rudrayamala Tantra, samayachara means the complete process of
                initiation by Master in which Kundalini activation-Raising of

              <p>
                The word Samaya comes from 'samyam yati' meaning that the
                equality of Masculine-Shiva and Feminine-Shakti energies in

              <p>
                01. Adhishthana samaya - similarity in abode , 02. Anushthana
                samaya - oneness in indulgence of activities , 03. Avastha
                samaya- similarity and equality in the state as Tandava and
                Lasya , 04. Naama samaya- similarity in the names and 05. Roopa
                samaya - similarity in the form and colour, that means they are
                not separate, different and both are one meaning Shiva is her
                Transcendent masculine aspect, providing the divine ground of
                all being. There is no Shiva without Shakti, or Shakti without
                Shiva. The two in themselves are One.

                more types of Kundalini activation methods in Levels 01 & 02 of

                The right method and authentic yoga tantra methods are very
                secret, sacred and mystic techniques, these techniques are
                formed on scientific, experiential, process based practices
                which is very rarely available,
                <b>Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana</b> is one among such simple yet
                powerful and effective technique.
              </p>
              <p>
                Simple yet effective is because the sadhak learns and practices
                to journey the Mind through various conscious levels and states
                of consciousness through <b>Eshwari Dhyana,</b> the sadhak
                undergoes karmic cleansing acquired from the past lives through
                <b>Immortal Process</b> where he/she is made to realize the
                immortality of his/her existence and witness the lifes' of his
                past, understand the cause of birth, identify and nullify the
                rough psychic impressions. Through <b>Know Your Purpose</b>
                workshop, sadhaks undergo a certain effective yogic process
                which makes them realize a very rare knowledge which is very
                important to lead a self satisfied and holistic way of living,
                possible when the sadhaks understand his/her purpose of present
                life. Through Guruji's personal scientific research and
                observation on Sri Vidhya yoga tantra and the personal practice
                on the same, the benefits and results out of the practice proved
                to turn out marvelous, here are some of them as mentioned so
                that one can agree that indeed Sri Vidhya Samayachara method is
                very scientific. Yet, to gain official response a research has
                to be conducted and needs to be submitted for clinical
                experiments, verifications and inference but one thing is
                confirmed that Sri Vidhya Eshwari Sadhana is the Scientific
                practice and not at all hypothetic or just a belief .

                culture, Egypt traditions and Sufism have accepted and spoken of
                the importance but, only Islamic belief system does not accept.
